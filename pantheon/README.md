# pantheon.csv

## Brief Description

This is a dataset curated by the MIT Pantheon Media Lab of figures who have been influential in 'global cultural production'. Each row represents an individual person, and some information associated with that person collected from their wikipedia page. For instance, 'PageViewsEnglish' represents the number of page views this person had obtained on the English version of their Wikipedia page at the time when the data were collected. For more information on how the media lab chose these figures, see this page: http://pantheon.media.mit.edu/methods

NOTE: This dataset is very similar, but NOT identical to a dataset we will provide to you as part of a future assignment. Please don't get them confused!
