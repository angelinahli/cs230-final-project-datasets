## Brief Description

A set of text files containing high school essays, divided up into three sections:
* big_doc_set - 1,354 docs -- around 1,615,193 words
* med_doc_set - 75 docs -- around 91,273 words
* sm_doc_set - 25 docs -- around 33,946 words

Some of these essays will be plagiarised - i.e. will contain fragments of other essays in that set. More information from the original data source:

> All documents are (usually bad) "high school" essays pulled from the website www.freeessays.cc. There may still be some lingering html floating around some documents.
> This is D.I.Y. plagiarism, for the most part. Each set contains one plagiarized documet called catchmeifyoucan.txt.
> "medium" and "small" sets of documentts are just subsets of the big document set.

## Data Snapshot

Here's the beginning of the file `sm_doc_set/abf0704.txt`:

> Nineteen Eighty-Four was written between the years of 1945 and 1948. Orwell got the title from switching the last two numbers of the publication date. In OrwellÕs criticism of a perfect society, his book became known as one of the greatest anti-utopian novels of all time. The bookÕs message is so powerful that some say it went so far as to prevent the sinister future from realizing itself.
